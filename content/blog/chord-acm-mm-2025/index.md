We are happy to share that **CHORD** has been accepted to **ACM MM 2025**. CHORD studies how to give each user a personalized recommendation model that runs **on their own device**, without training or fine-tuning a separate model per user.

On-device recommendation is attractive because it is private, low-latency, and reduces server load. Making the on-device model *personal*, however, is expensive: one either fine-tunes on the device, which requires backpropagation, or ships a fresh model to every user, which consumes substantial bandwidth. CHORD instead casts personalization as a **quantization** problem rather than a **training** problem.

## The challenge: customization and compression at the same time

Device-cloud recommendation faces several tensions simultaneously:

- **Interest and resource heterogeneity.** Users differ in taste, and their devices differ in memory, compute, and bandwidth.
- **Evolving interests.** User behavior drifts over time, so a one-shot deployment becomes stale.
- **Frequent transmission under limited bandwidth.** Distributing updated weights to many devices is costly.

The result is a coupled requirement: a model must be **customized** to the user and **compressed** to the device *simultaneously*, while keeping device-cloud communication inexpensive.

## CHORD in one idea: find the ideal channel-wise quantization strategy for each instance

CHORD is built on a single principle:

> **Frozen weights + a channel-wise quantization strategy = fast *and* personalized adaptation.**

The central observation is that personalization can be expressed as a **"lottery ticket" inside mixed-precision quantization**. Every device keeps the **same frozen backbone**; personalization is encoded entirely as a **per-user, per-channel bit-width assignment** — which channels retain higher precision and which are quantized more aggressively. Searching for this winning bit-width pattern is performed off-device, while applying it on-device requires no training.

This yields three properties simultaneously: an importance-aware **mixed-precision (~3-bit)** model for efficient inference, a **compact strategy** of **2 bits per channel** for transmission, and adaptation in **a single forward pass**, without on-device backpropagation.

## Generating the personalized strategy

The strategy is produced by three components:

1. **User profiling generator.** From the user's **real-time interactions**, the model derives latent interest embeddings that summarize the user's current interests.
2. **Multi-granularity sensitivity generator.** A set of **hypernetworks** estimates parameter importance at three granularities — **element**, **filter**, and **layer**. Filter-level importance is reconstructed from element-level signals and then weighted by layer-level importance.
3. **Personalized strategy generator.** The combined importance is converted into a **channel-wise mixed-precision strategy**: sensitive channels retain higher precision, the remainder are quantized lower. Only the strategy — not the weights — is encoded and transmitted, and it is decoded on-device according to the available resource budget.

## Why it is efficient

The design pays off along four axes at the same time:

- **Better recommendation** — models are personalized to each user rather than shared across all users.
- **Faster adaptation** — a single forward pass, with no on-device training.
- **Faster inference** — an importance-aware mixed-precision (~3-bit) model.
- **Lighter transmission** — only 2 bits per channel are transmitted, instead of full 32-bit weights.

## Experiments

We evaluate CHORD on three real-world datasets (**Amazon-CDs, Yelp, ML-100K**) with two standard sequential-recommendation backbones, **SASRec** and **Caser**, reporting **NDCG@5/10** and **HR@5/10**. Against both full-precision and compressed baselines, CHORD achieves **higher recommendation performance**, **higher inference and adaptation efficiency**, and **lower transmission overhead**.

Beyond the main comparison, the paper further shows that CHORD:

- **degrades gracefully** under tighter budgets and **supports different average bit-widths** for adaptive deployment;
- **supports weight–activation quantization**, not only weight quantization;
- **trains stably** while reaching higher performance; and
- through visualization, **confirms that importance is genuinely heterogeneous** across both layers and channels — which is what makes a per-user, per-channel strategy worthwhile.

## Takeaway

Personalizing an on-device model need not require training one per user. CHORD reframes customization as **searching for a per-user quantization lottery ticket** and splitting the work across device and cloud — shared frozen weights, a compact channel-wise strategy, and a single forward pass. This device-cloud, quantization-first formulation offers a practical path to personalized models that remain deployable on resource-constrained devices.
