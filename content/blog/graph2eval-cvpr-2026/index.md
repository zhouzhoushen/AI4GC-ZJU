We are happy to share that **Graph2Eval** has been accepted to **CVPR 2026**.

Agent benchmarks are moving fast, but many evaluations still rely on **fixed datasets and leaderboard scores**. That setup is easy to run, yet it creates a familiar risk: models may improve on a narrow test distribution through memorization or overfitting, while true tool use, information understanding, and multi-step reasoning remain under-tested.

Graph2Eval takes a different angle. Instead of asking an LLM to invent tasks from raw text alone, we first build a **knowledge graph (KG)** from external documents and web pages, then sample structured subgraphs and instantiate tasks from that graph. The goal is evaluation that stays **scalable, controllable, and semantically grounded**.

## The problem with static agent benchmarks

Static datasets are invaluable as baselines, but they struggle to keep pace with agent capabilities and deployment settings:

- **Limited scalability.** Manual annotation and fixed environment design are expensive to extend.
- **Weak semantic structure.** LLM-only synthesis often misses explicit entity–relation modeling, which can hurt task consistency and solvability.
- **Narrow transfer.** Tasks built from simplified or frozen page layouts may not reflect dynamic real-world websites.

In other words, a high score on a fixed suite does not automatically mean an agent will generalize when the environment changes.

## Graph2Eval in one pass

Graph2Eval treats the KG as a **latent task space**. The pipeline has five stages:

1. **Data ingestion** — parse documents and crawl web pages while preserving layout semantics (headings, tables, links, forms, screenshots).
2. **KG construction** — map entities and interactions to nodes and edges with multimodal representations.
3. **Subgraph sampling** — extract task-relevant structures via templates and meta-path strategies.
4. **Task generation** — compose executable task instances with LLM-assisted context engineering.
5. **Coverage optimization** — filter tasks with reachability checks, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis.

This design supports both **RAG agent** scenarios (multimodal document understanding) and **web agent** scenarios (multi-step interaction on realistic pages).

## Why the knowledge graph matters

The KG is not just metadata decoration. It gives us a place to enforce structure before task text is written:

- **Nodes** capture paragraphs, headings, hyperlinks, forms, buttons, tables, and related UI elements.
- **Edges** encode semantic, structural, and interactive relations across content.
- **Meta-paths** specify which node types and relations a valid task should traverse.

Sampling a subgraph first makes it easier to control **what the task is about** before generating natural-language instructions. That reduces the “plausible but unsolvable” failure mode common in free-form LLM task synthesis.

## What you can control

A major advantage of graph-based generation is **explicit control over task difficulty and capability coverage**:

| Knob | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| Path length | Overall task complexity and number of reasoning hops |
| Node-type constraints | Which skills are required — retrieval, reasoning, UI operation, etc. |
| Sampling strategy | Task distribution and diversity across the benchmark |

This is the difference between a leaderboard that measures familiarity and an evaluation pipeline that measures **adaptation under changing structure**.

## Graph2Eval-Bench and results

We instantiated the framework as **Graph2Eval-Bench**, a curated set of **1,319 tasks**:

- **1,002** document-understanding tasks
- **317** web-interaction tasks

Compared with a KG-free baseline, Graph2Eval improves average **semantic consistency by 20%** and **solvability by 17%**. Generation is also practical: about **35 seconds** per document task and **96 seconds** per web task on average. Across LLM configurations, Graph2Eval-Bench provides clearer separation of agent performance than static suites alone.

## Takeaway

We believe agent evaluation should move toward **dynamic, structure-aware task generation** — not just larger static test sets. Graph2Eval is our step in that direction: use graphs to define what a task *means*, then generate language and interaction around that structure.

If you are working on agent benchmarking, RAG systems, or web agents, we would love to hear your feedback.
